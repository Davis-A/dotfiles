This i should do in no particular order:
- add a README.md with chezmoi basics because i'll come back to this in 12 months and will need an ELI5
 - eg how to pull it down from scratch
 - how the chezmoi.toml works and how you have to init on each change
 - how to handle secrets with my dumb local based answer
